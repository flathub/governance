# Flathub Community Values

NOTE: This document is WIP and a draft

Flathub Community culture is essential to the success to the project's success. The following values have been identified to guide the community and project in ongoing and future decisions and work.

## Global community

Distributed asynchronous ownership, collaboration, communication, and decision making are the cornerstones of our global community.

## Community over product or company

The Flathub service and community is aiming for the benefit of all its members and users everywhere. The Flathub community may include members from specific products or companies, but are also welcoming everyone else. This will influence the content on [Flathub.org](https://flathub.org/) that include apps spanning from open source to proprietary software.

## Openness over exclusivity

Openness is becoming increasingly central to the ways groups, teams, and communities of all sizes are working together to achieve shared goals. Open organizations take many shapes. Their sizes, compositions, and missions vary. But the following five characteristics are the hallmarks of any open organization:

- Transparency
- Inclusivity
- Adaptability
- Collaboration
- Community

## Respect for people

Respect for people starts with a passion for serving the community and society. People are always in the center--people in every function across the community as well as partners and users. We aim to constantly develop and improve on how we work, both individually and together.

## Continuous improvement

Without continuous improvement the project will stagnate and eventually deteriorate. We will challenge status quo, use systematic problem solving, and appreciate teamwork.
