# Flathub Community Values

Flathub Community culture is essential to the success to the project's success. The following values have been identified to guide the community and project in ongoing and future decisions and work.

## Global community
Distributed asynchronous ownership, collaboration, communication, and decision making are the cornerstones of our global community.

## Community over product or company
The Flathub service and community is aiming for the benefit of all its members and users everywhere. The Flathub community may include members from specific products or companies, but also welcoming everyone else. This will also influence the content on [Flathub.org](https://flathub.org/) that do and will include apps that are open source and proprietary software.


- Openness
- Diversity and inclusion
- Continuous improvement
